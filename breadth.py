        Performs a breadth-first search on a graph from a given start node.

        Parameters:
         - graph (list of list of int): The graph represented as a list, where each index is a node and each element is a list of the node's neighbors.
         - start (int): The starting node's index for the BFS traversal.

        Returns:
            - None: This function does not return a value but prints the order of traversal.
