def depth_first_search(graph, start):
    """
    Initiates a depth-first search on a graph from a specified start node.

    Parameters:
    - graph (list of list of int): The graph, represented as a list where each index is a node and each element is a list of that node's neighbors.
    - start (int): The index of the starting node for the DFS traversal.

    Returns:
    - None: This function does not return a value but prints the order of traversal.
